# Passing Thoughts
A collection of items I have collected that resonated at the time. 

- **Maximize personal energy** Always try to optimize personal energy (Something which you a positive mental or physical lift), some people enjoy solace, some crowded places, decide what maximizes your personal energy and do those activities in spare time.
- Do 1 permissionless thing per day, even if small. This is no different than going to the gym or brushing your teeth every day - you’re building a habit to rewire your brain.
	- Instead of asking “How do I meet person X?” ask “What problem can I solve for X?”
	- Instead of asking “How do I get a job?” ask “Who can I make look amazing?”
- Remove “What If” thinking. People don’t act because they overthink worst-case scenarios, so just reframe them:
    - “What if I get ignored becomes “what if I land a life-changing opportunity?”
    - “What if this flops?” becomes “What if this becomes a viral hit?”
    - “What if they don’t respond?” becomes “What if they love it and reach out?”
- Get to 100 “Nos.” Getting rejected is a blessing, it gets you closer to a yes.
- “You either win or your lose?” No, that’s stupid. You either win or you learn or you walk away with a great story. So it’s impossible to lose.
